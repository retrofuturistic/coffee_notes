#Coffee Notes#

##Introduction##
This is as javascript web application (prepped for mobile) based on the backbone-scaffold app.  All libraries are included in the lib folder.  The tpl folder contains templates.  

##The Mission##
This Coffee Notes repo is not forked from backbone-scaffold because it is not a variation on that repo.  It actually has a lot of functionality and application specific behavior, look and styling.  This an app to record your notes on the coffees that you've tasted much like a wine notes application.  

Eventually, I would like to add more support for roaster information, geolocation to help you find the coffees you like as well as camera support.

Warning: Because I used WebSQL, this application works on Chrome, Safari and FireFox.  Internet Explorer does not support WebSQL.
